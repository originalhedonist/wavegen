Monica gradually increases in amplitude up until the 20 minute mark - by a factor of either 3, 5 or 8.
During this first 20 minutes the carrier frequency stays at 1200Hz.
Then at 20 minutes, once it has reached maximum amplitude, it starts dropping the carrier frequency,
gradually decreasing until it reaches 320Hz by the 40 minute mark.
Then, it stays at maximum amplitude and 320Hz for the last 20 minutes.
